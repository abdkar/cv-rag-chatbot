# 🔧 File Upload Error Fix

**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Issue:** File upload errors in CV RAG Chatbot  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## 🚨 Original Problems

### Error 1: Type Mismatch
```
Error saving uploaded content: write() argument must be str, not UploadedFile
```

### Error 2: Processing Failure
```
Error processing file
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `save_uploaded_content()` function in `src/utils/file_processing.py`:

**Problem:** 
- Function expected a `string` parameter
- App was passing a Streamlit `UploadedFile` object
- No proper file content extraction was happening

**Code Issue:**
```python
# OLD - BROKEN
def save_uploaded_content(content: str) -> bool:
    # Expected string, got UploadedFile object
```

## ✅ Complete Fix Implemented

### 1. **Updated Function Signature**
```python
# NEW - WORKING
def save_uploaded_content(uploaded_file: Any) -> Optional[str]:
    # Now accepts UploadedFile object and returns extracted content
```

### 2. **Added Proper File Processing**
- **PDF Support:** Uses `pypdf` to extract text from PDF files
